    <h2>Rainbows and More!</h2>
<br>
    <p>This page is about the rainbow.  I'm going to talk about the rainbow aand all there is to know about it.</p>
<br><br>
    <h3>Rainbows</h3>
<br>
    <p>There are actually more than one type of rainbow.  It's called a double rainbow.  But surprisingly, a rainbow we see after a 
        rainy day actually has two all the time!  But the second one isn't really seen.  Double rainbows repsent transformation.  
        Spiritual transformation to be exact.</p>
